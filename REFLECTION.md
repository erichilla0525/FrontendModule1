Can I explain what my code does?
It is a personal resume including multiple section(personal intro,educational background,personal skills,employee history)

What was my coding process?
The structure is easy to understand based on my previous resume making experience, I just follow the coding structure
from the lab and activity in module1 and finish the coding

What challenges did I have?
Trouble shooting process, I finally find it just a coding indentation problem, but the description on validation platform 
is more detail, which caused some time been wasted.

What would I do differently now?
The design especially the layout, I also want to add some personal artistry to improve its ui design.
